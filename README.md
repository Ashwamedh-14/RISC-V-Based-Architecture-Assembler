# RISC-V BASED ARCHITECTURE ASSEMBLER

## About

The assembler is designed to translate assembly instruction into equivalent hexadecimal code for RISC-V based processor as designed in [Digital Model of Processor](./Digital%20Model%20of%20Processor.circ). The full list of Valid OP Codes are given in the text file [Valid OP Codes](./Valid%20OP%20Codes.txt) along with the information that would be required to pass for that OP Code for it to be a valid instruction.

> **NOTE**  
> The design of the processor is done by **[Prof. Mazad Zaveri][1]** of **[School of Engineering and Applied Sciences][2], [Ahmedabad University][3]** for the course **CSE302 Computer Organization and Architecture**. All rights of the design of the processor rests with him along with the **Instruction Set** that is valid for the processor.

## Pre-installation

1. Ensure you have a [`C++ Compiler`](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/) installed and available on system path.
2. Ensure you have [`Logisim`](https://sourceforge.net/projects/circuit/#) installed.  

> **Note**  
> It is preferable to use the `GNU C/C++` compiler.  
> Ensure you have `C++11` or greater (`C++17` is recommended).  
> `Logisim` requires `Java 5` or later to run.

## Setting Up

Visit the [**Releases**](https://github.com/Ashwamedh-14/RISC-V-Based-Architecture-Assembler/releases) page to download precompiled executables:

- For **Windows x64**: Download `Assembler_x64.exe`
- For **Linux**: Download `Assembler`
- Or you can download the `zip` file for either of the two.

> **Note**: macOS users must build from source due to platform restrictions on unsigned executables. See "Building from Source" below.

### Post-download (Linux Users)

Before running the downloaded file:

```bash
cd /path/to/download
chmod +x Assembler
```

If the executable does not run on your Linux system, follow the build instructions below.

### Building from Source

Clone the repo and build the executable using the below given commands.

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/Ashwamedh-14/RISC-V-Based-Architecture-Assembler.git
cd RISC-V-Based-Architecture-Assembler
make
```

The compiled binary will be located at bin/Assembler

> **Note:** Ensure you have `g++` and `make` installed. Use your system's package manager (e.g., sudo apt install build-essential on Debian based distros).

## Using

- Write your `assembly` program in a `text file` and name it `asmcode.txt`.
- Place the executable file in the same directory as `asmcode.txt`.
- Run the executable file.
- Two text files with the name `hexcode.txt` and `bin.txt` should be formed.
- You can upload this file in the `ROM` of your processor.

### MacOS and Linux Users

In case the executable file does not run upon clicking it, especially in the case of `MacOS`, try the following steps:

- Open the `terminal`
- Type in the following command
  
  ``` Bash
  cd "path/to/your/executable"
  ```

- Make sure your `asmcode.txt` is in the same `directory`.
- Run the command below

  ``` Bash
  # For MacOS Users
  ./Assembler_MacOS

  # For Linux (Ubuntu) Users
  ./Assembler  
  ```

- `hexcode.txt` and `bin.txt` should now be generated.

### Command Line Arguments

By default, you don't have to explicitly provide the name of the output file for hexadecimal code or binary code, given the input file, `asmcode.txt` is located in the same folder as the executable and is readable. However, if you wish you can specify all the three files through command line arguments, along with a couple of other functionalities.

The general syntax of command line arguments are:

``` Bash
./Assembler -flag <value> ...
```

Here, `-flag` can mean any-one, or more of the following:

- `-i \<input_file\>`: Input file containing `assembly` code (default: asmcode.txt)
- `-o \<output_file\>`: Output file in which `hexadecimal` code will be stored (default: hexcode.txt)
- `-b \<binary_file\>`: Output file in which `binary` code will be stored (default: bin.txt)
- `-n`: Tells `Assembler` to not generate `binary` code
- `-h`: Outputs the help message, as given here

Kindly keep the following points in mind

- All flags followed by `<value>` means that they expect you to pass a value to them when invoked.
- The ordering of the flags do not matter
- `-n` will always override the behavior of `-b`.
- `-h` will always override the behavior of rest of the flags. In fact, passing the `-h` flag means the `Assembler` will only output the help section, and will not assemble your source code.
- All I/O files are supposed to be text files.

## Syntax

Welcome to the syntax of the assembly language, where we will go over some nitpicky stuff while you might be writing your code.

### Statements

All statements start with a valid `opcode`. This is usually followed by the required `parameters` for that `opcode`. For example, for `opcode` `AND` you might write

``` txt
AND,R12,R1,R2;
```

Notice the use of **commas** to separate the `parameters` of the `opcode`. Use of these commas is **important**, both for successful compilation, and for your understanding. For the correct `syntax` and `parameters` for each `opcode`, kindly refer to [**Valid OP Codes**](./Valid%20OP%20Codes.txt)

### Ending a Line

**Each** line ends at the **first** **semicolon** encountered in the line. For example:

``` txt
AND,R12,R1,R2;
```

In this case, the line ends after `R2`, which is expected. However, when we write

``` txt
AND,R12;,R1,R2;
```

The line ends after `R12`.

### Comments

The **first** **semicolon** of the line demarcates the start of comments for that line. For example:

``` txt
AND,R12,R1,R2;        This is a comment
;                     This is also a comment
                      This is not a comment and will be parsed
```

### Blank Lines

Blank lines are replaced with `0000000`, i.e. `NOP`, in `hexcode.txt`

### Points to remember

- **All** `opcodes` are `keywords`.
- **All** `regs` are referenced by their decimal values. For example:
  - `R1` is correct
  - `R10` is correct
  - `R01` is correct and also equivalent to `R1`
  - `RA` is incorrect
- **All** `DAT`, `PORT Address`, `MEM Address` values are passed, parsed and taken as `8-bit hexadecimals`.

## Error Codes

These are the error numbers that you might encounter during runtime. Attached is their meaning as well

- 00: All good
- 01: Input File is not a text file
- 02: Output File is not a text file
- 03: Binary File is not a text file
- 04: Unable to Find or Open the Input File, probably because not available at the specified path, or no read permission.
- 05: Unable to Find or Open the Output File, probably because not available at the specified path, or no write permission.
- 06: Unable to Find or Open the Binary File, probably because not available at the specified path, or no write permission.
- 07: There was error in Arguments Passed to the Program
- 08: There were some Errors in Assembly Code, due to which the equivalent binary file could not be generated.

> **Kindly Note**
>
> Error Codes 01â€“07 are command line argument based, and are used to verify the correct type of arguments are passed to the program.

## Technical Details

- The numbering for the assembler starts at 1, i.e., the first line of the input file is numbered 1.
- The assembler is **case-insensitive**.
- The processor is a `8-bit` processor, i.e., its `regs` are capable of storing `8 bits`, or a `byte`, of data at a time.
- The processor has a `25-bit` wide `Instruction Memory Bus`, where:
  - The first `5 bits` are reserved for `OP Code`.
  - The next `12 bits` are distributed among 3, `4bit` wide `reg address`. The distribution is:
    - The first `4 bits` are reserved for `Rw`, i.e., `Register Write`.
    - The next `4 bits` are reserved for `Rx`, i.e., `Register Read1`.
    - The last `4 bits` are reserved for `Ry`, i.e., `Register Read2`.
  - The last `8 bits` is reserved for `DAT`. It carries `immediate data`, `MEM Address`, `Port Address`.
- The total number of `regs` available are **16**. This means valid `regs` are `R0` - `R15`.
- The `MEM Address` is taken as `8-bit hexadecimal`. This means valid `MEM Address` are `00` - `FF`.
- Data can be read from and written to `MEM` only by `regs`.
- Valid `input` ports are `F1`, `F2`, `F3` and `F4`.
- Valid `ouput` ports are `F8`, `F9`, `FA` and `FB`.
- Specifying any other `input` or `output` port will result in a `logic error`.
- Same as `MEM`, to read / write data to any `I/O` port, you will need to use `regs`.
- The compiled binaries are compatible with `x64` architecture **only**.
